<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p> I created a rasterizer by implementing single color triangle rasterization, adding supersampling to avoid aliasing, adding compatibiltiy for transforms including translate/rotate/scale, implementing linear interpolation across triangles using barycentric coordinates to color triangles, drawing textured triangles using nearest neighbor interpolation and bilinear interpolation, and drawing textured triangles using mipmaps for "level sampling". I wish I had more time to implement cooler stuff with extra credit, but I learned a lot including how to use html to write this write-up :)

<h2 align="middle">Section I: Rasterization</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles (20 pts)</h3>

<p> I followed lecture 2 and implemented the three line test. If the point passed the three line test and was inside the triangle (L >= 0), I would rasterize the point using fill pixel. For the winding order for test6, I did a boolean check for outside at the end and both "inside" and "outside" should be rasterized the same way. My algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle because it only checks for inclusion within the bounding box of the triangle in the for loop with max height and width of the bounding box. Below are screenshots of my rasterized triangles for basic/test3.svg, basic/test4.svg (with the pixel inspector centered on an interesting part of the scene), basic/test5.svg, and basic/test6.svg.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling (20 pts)</h3>
<p> My supersampling algorithm updates the RasterizerImp::rasterize_triangle() and RasterizerImp::resolve_to_framebuffer() functions. I followed lecture 3 and edited the unsupersampled triangle rasterization implementation to account for the new sample rate in RasterizerImp::rasterize_triangle(). The two new for loops go through the super sample rate pixels within the boundary box of the triangle. In RasterizerImp::resolve_to_framebuffer(), I implemented a seperation between the sample buffer and frame buffer to divide the color in the sample buffer by the sample rate before writing to the frame buffer. Supersampling is useful because it allows us to remove aliasing such as jaggies and display "sharper" images. The part of the rasterization pipeline process I modified was the rasterization part after triangle assembly of coloring and drawing the triangles in SVG::draw and DrawRend::redraw. By sampling at the new sampling rate at i and j, we sample more times per pixel than just once. After assigning colors at those pixels in the sample buffer, we downsample in the frame buffer which produces a better result with blurier edges because each pixel was sampled more than once. Below are screenshots of basic/test4.svg with the default viewing parameters and sample rates 1, 4, and 16 to compare them side-by-side. These results are due to the pixel getting sampled multiple times which allows the rasterizer to more accurately identify the edges of the triangle and the blurring effect is due to downasampling and calculating what ratio of the pixel is "inside" the triangle.

<p>My robot is doing a handstand. The transforms I implemented were translating every body part (ex. head lower from -100 to 90, legs higher from 90 to -165, etc.) and rotating the upper arms 45 degrees and the lower arms 90 degrees.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Barycentric coordinates</h3>
<p>
Barycentric coordinates are a coordinate system that allows us to plot a point relative to the vertices of a triangle, and we use it here to linearly interpolate triangles rasterizing them with more than one color. I used the supersampled rasterization code from task 2 and added the calculations for alpha, beta, and gamma from lecture 5 to calculate the point's color. Below is a screenshot of a triangle showing barycentric coordinates in action (the corners are green, pink, and yellow) and svg/basic/test7.svg with default viewing parameters and sample rate 1.

      </td>
    </tr>
    <br>
  </table>
</div>

</p>



<h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>
<p>
I implemented pixel sampling by editing my triangle rasterization implementation by adding the linear algebra matrix multiplication from lecture 5 because adding to my calculation of alpha, beta, and gamma from task 4 was taking too long. I did task 5 and 6 together because I struggled wtith task 5. I created a matrix of the three triangle vertices, vectors of the u v coordinates and multiplied them to calculate the barycentric coordinates in rasterizer.cpp. In texture.cpp, I implemented nearest sampling and bilinear sampling. For Texture::sample_nearest() I calculated the nearest pixel to the point (x,y) and returned the color from the mip.get_texel. For Texture::sample_bilinear() I implemented bilinear filtering by LERPing through the four nearest pixels to the point (x,y), LERPing twice horizontally and LERPing once vertically. Bilinear pixel sampling produces better results nearest pixel sampling because instead of just sampling the nearest point, we perform linear interpolation on the points. In texmap2, the difference between nearest sampling and bilinear sampling is that bilinear sampling is an improvement to nearest sampling. There will be a large difference between the two methods when sampling 1 sample per pixel over 16 samples per pixel because there are are clearer advantages to bilinear sampling over nearest sampling because there is more aliasing when sampling with 1 sample. Below are the screenshots using nearest sampling at 1 sample per pixel, nearest sampling at 16 samples per pixel, bilinear sampling at 1 sample per pixel, and bilinear sampling at 16 samples per pixel.

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>
<p>
Level sampling for texture mapping is when we sample textures and use mipmaps to downsample and store downsampled textures. To implemented level sampling, I filled in Texture::get_level() to get the mipmap level by calculating the difference vectors between the barycentric coordinates and scaling the max of the two difference vectors with log. I implemented Texture::sample() for each level sample method and edited the triangle rasterization as described in task 5. 

Speed:
1. level nearest, bilinear sampling
2. level nearest, nearest sampling
3. level zero, bilinear sampling
4. level zero, nearest sampling
Memory Usage:
1. level zero, nearest sampling
2. level zero, bilinear sampling
3. level nearest, nearest sampling
4. level nearest, bilinear sampling
Antialiasing Power:
1. level nearest, bilinear sampling
2. level zero, bilinear sampling
3. level nearest, nearest sampling
4. level zero, nearest sampling
